# Quine-McCluskey-Multifunctions

This project implements the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm in the four possible ways: 

1. One function without Doesn't care conditions.
2. One function with Doesn't care conditions.
3. Multiple-functions without Doesn't care conditions.
4. Multiple-functions with Doesn't care conditions.

The algorithm is designed for working for an input of n-variables and the multiple-functions algorithm is also designed for working with an input of n-independent functions.
Using GUI you can only select a total of 6 independent functions up to 10 independent variables each one.

This project was fully programmed in Java using the NetBeans IDE.
It is designed using the OOP paradigm although there are some global variables and functions with procedural paradigm (I was not so proficient at OOP-Paradigm when designed the project).

This project was my Dissertation at Universidad De Castilla-La Mancha.
Feel free to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and/or the data structures used, as well as re-designing for a full OOP paradigm if you want to.
